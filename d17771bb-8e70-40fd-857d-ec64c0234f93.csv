I took down my big beer posts from this page (I think I got them all, but if I haven't, let me know), and have started unfollowing pages where I see big beer posted regularly. It'll be hard to silence the BCBS machine, but hopefully we can suck all the air out of the room and make a difference",1

"Yes! First, get naked in your shower/tub to cover everywhere with sunscreen! Then get dressed.

They're so tasty and satisfying. They won't crumble either. Salt for the win!!!",1
